# TDD project

In this project I implement a class with some methods, by doing test-driven development (TDD). The idea is to write tests first and then the code. 

## Built With
- Ruby

## Getting Started
- git clone https://github.com/lilyfrancis/tdd-project.git
- cd tdd-project

- Make sure you have `Ruby` installed in your system. You can install it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
- To run the `tests` make sure you install rspec gem by running `gem install rspec` on the command line then run `rspec spec` on the command line to see the test passing
